##  How It Works

- **Room Creation:** Users can create a new room with a unique slug.  
- **Room Validation:** If someone tries to access `/room/[slug]` directly, the app verifies if that room exists in the database.  
- **WebSocket Connection:** Once inside a room, users connect via WebSocket channels for real-time drawing and messaging.  
- **Sync & Persistence:** Changes are broadcast instantly to all connected clients and stored in database simultaneoulsy.  
- **Authentication:** Secure login with NextAuth ensures only verified users can join or create rooms.
